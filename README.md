Basic CRUD Functionality:
---

### 1. Create Inventory Items

Make sure to fill in all of the fields (Title, Price, Stock, Description). If you don't fill in any of these fields, you will get alerted that you need to meet the requirements. 

You cannot create an item with the same title. If you try to do so, you will get an alert.

You will get an alert that the item is successfully created if you meet all the requirements.


### 2. Edit Inventory Items

You need to fill in the Old Title field that you wish to edit. Also, you need to fill in at least one of the fields: New Title, New Price, New Stock, New Description. 

If you don't fill in any of the 3 "New" fields, you will get an alert.

If you don't fill in a field (under the circumstance that you put at least one field), it will save the previous information. In other words, you don't have to fill in description and title fields again just to change the price.

You will get an alert that the item is successfully created if you meet all the requirements.

### 3. Delete Inventory Items
